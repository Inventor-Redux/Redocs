# List

## Summary
A list is a collection of data normally separated by a comma

## Usage
Many different blocks and triggers use this such as the [Member Role IDs](/inventor-reference/blocks/users/get-server-member/#member-role-ids) output of the [Get Server Member](/inventor-reference/blocks/users/get-server-member/) block

## Example

The [Member Role IDs](/inventor-reference/blocks/users/get-server-member/#member-role-ids) output of the [Get Server Member](/inventor-reference/blocks/users/get-server-member/) block contains the id of every role the member has, separated by a comma. For example if the member had two roles with the id's of `1281283492109484165` and `1288255378642960416` then the output would have the value of `1281283492109484165,1288255378642960416`
