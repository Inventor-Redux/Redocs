# Float

## Summary
A float is used to represent a real(decimal) value

## Usage
Many different blocks and triggers use this such as the [Result](/inventor-reference/blocks/math/math-operations-(float)/#result) output of the [Math Operations (Float)](/inventor-reference/blocks/math/math-operations-(float)/) block

## Example

The [Result](/inventor-reference/blocks/math/math-operations-(float)/#result) output of the [Math Operations (Float)](/inventor-reference/blocks/math/math-operations-(float)/) block contains the result of the operation performed by the block which may be a float. If for example the operation performed was `5 / 2` then the output would have the value of `2.5`
