# Number

## Summary
A variable that uses a number can have the value of any integer

## Usage
Many different blocks and triggers use this such as the [Row Count](/inventor-reference/blocks/databases/get-row-count/#row-count) output of the [Get Row Count](/inventor-reference/blocks/databases/get-row-count/) block

## Example

The [Row Count](/inventor-reference/blocks/databases/get-row-count/#row-count) output of the [Get Row Count](/inventor-reference/blocks/databases/get-row-count/) block contains the exact number of rows currently in the database. If for example the database had 99 rows then the output would have the value of `99`
