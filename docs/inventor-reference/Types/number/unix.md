# UNIX

## Summary
UNIX is a way of storing time in a machine readable way, it is the number of seconds or milliseconds (depending on the format) since 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970

## Usage
Many different blocks and triggers use this such as the [Current Time (Unix)](/inventor-reference/triggers/scheduled-triggers/every-minute/#current-time-unix) output of the [Every Minute](/inventor-reference/triggers/scheduled-triggers/every-minute/) trigger

## Example
 
The [Current Time (Unix)](/inventor-reference/triggers/scheduled-triggers/every-minute/#current-time-unix) output of the [Every Minute](/inventor-reference/triggers/scheduled-triggers/every-minute/) trigger contains the current time in UNIX. If for example the current time was 21:29:51 UTC on the Friday 27 September 2024 then the output would have the value of `1727468991`
